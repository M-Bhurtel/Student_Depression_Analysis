# Student Depression Analysis

## Objective
This project explores patterns related to **depression** among students using various academic, social, and lifestyle factors. The aim is to identify contributing factors and gain insights into student well-being.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
- **Jupyter Notebook**: for data exploration and visualization

## Key Findings:
- **Academic Pressure** and **Financial Stress** are major contributors to depression.
- **Study Satisfaction** is inversely correlated with depression, with lower satisfaction linked to higher depression.
- **Dietary Habits** and **Suicidal Thoughts** were also strongly associated with depression.
  
## Insights:
- **Students with high academic pressure and low study satisfaction** are more likely to report depression.
- Interventions in **stress management** and **academic satisfaction** could significantly impact students' mental health.
  
## How to Run the Project:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook `Student_depression_analysis.ipynb` in your local environment.
3. Run each cell in sequence to see the data analysis process and visualizations.

## Next Steps:
- **Mental health interventions** for students with high academic pressure.
- Further analysis to explore **causal relationships**.
